  <description>Adds buildable floors that look like natural rock, in rough or rough-hewn variations.
            Faster to build than Tiled Floors but also slightly more expensive.
            Can be smoothed.

            There are quite possibly some bugs because what I did was so scuffed.

            Also off Steam at: https://github.com/Toby222/FauxRockFloors

            Goes well with MBS Faux Rock Wall (https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=760281834)
